# Lambda Go Starter Project

This simple starter project demonstrates how to deploy a Go lambda using the Gin framework as an AWS Lambda.

For more information, please see this [blog post](https://maxrohde.com/2021/05/01/lambda-go-starter-project/).

This project is based on the [Go Gin Lambda Template](https://goldstack.party/templates/go-gin). You can use the Goldstack project builder to create a project like this one that will include all the latest updates and patches for the template.
